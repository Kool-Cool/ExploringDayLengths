# ExploringDayLengths

- Have you ever wondered why the length of the day changes during the year? 
- Did youknow that locations in the Antarctic can experience 24 hours of daylight in summer (and
none in winter)? This exhibit will allow you to explore how the rotation of the Earth and
its motion around the Sun determines the duration of daylight hours at any location on
the Earth.
